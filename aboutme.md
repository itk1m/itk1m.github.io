My name is Isaac Kim. I am following along with Soleyman cloud academy in learning about the cloud:

I am learning about cloud engineering because I really want a job and I believe it is possible to be a part of a growing

IT field demand in those who will become experts for businesses who are looking to be more cost efficient with all the data that they are receiving from their consumers and business partners. A lot of information is put out everyday and the importance in managing your data or giving it to others to manage gives others the consumers more breathing room in how they can operate. Of course it is going to become a very well paid field but in the end I believe that there is much to be gained from being a part of the community and putting myself out there as a upcoming cloud engineer looking for an opportunity to become part of a team that looks to make data management much simpler and less concerning to deal with. 

### My hobbies

I love to go on hikes, play some outdoor sports, eat Korean food, go on trips, spend time listening to some soft music. I try to read my Bible everyday and get to know a bit more about the wonders God has created and placed in my life. I don't know where I am going to go next or what will happen but I have complete faith that whatever will, there is a hope in me that can not be extinguished as long as I take the time to acknowledge that I am nothing without my Lord and Savior.

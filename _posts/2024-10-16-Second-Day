## Introduction to my journey for Git on MacOS

I downloaded my first git repository onto my macbook and it was not as hard as I thought. Git is a distributed version control system 
that I feel is very essential to learn and understand once I work officially in the tech field but as of right now I just am working
on projects related to cloud in my other cloud repository. This is something new and interesting to learn since I was not taught how 
do this in college which is surprising since it feels like a very important skill to have and understand. So I would say my investment
in the cloud academy is very much worth the pay and the videos with the step-by-step guide is very helpful. His explaination is on point 
and sincerity in explaining the concepts and the reasoning on what he does and what we should be doing as we progress through the course.

I am glad that I am growing in my education of cloud and I need to be putting in more effort. I am getting lazy so I will need make
sure that I make it a goal to at least spend one hour a day working on the cloud academy and spend some time working on a AWS certification
it is important that I know what the AWS is and how I know to apply that knowledge in real life.

## Learning about Cloud Architecture

The best description of what cloud architecture all about is a blueprint showing the relationships between the cloud components to create a cloud system. I find it amazing and interesting to find that the great systems or architectures that we have and use, recognize the relationships of the components and connect them while considering the strengths and weaknesses of the systems. Technology is advancing at a rapid pace and seeing the simple concepts of relationships being replicated shows that having consistent connection with others that are part of the system allows the growth of a network and the community. When designing an architecture, I have noticed that a lot of the concern are centered around the stakeholders who are being directly influenced by the service and if you are not meeting their requirements then no one in the world would want to use the service or system you are creating/designing.
